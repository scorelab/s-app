<h2>Introduction</h2>
This application is still under development. As of now, it consists of 3 tabs, namely: home, links and settings. The content under each tab is also under development. 

<h2>Implementation</h2>

This application is made using React Native which is a JavaScript framework that natively renders mobile applications for Android as well as iOS devices.


<h2>Prequisits</h2>
 
 - NodeJS : version 8.3.0
 - npm : version 5.3.0
 - Expo mobile application or an emulator 

<h2>Setting up the project</h2>

<b>Step 01</b>: In the command prompt navigate into "schain-app" folder and type
```
npm install

```
This will download all the necessary node packages.

<b>Step 02</b>: After all the node packages get downloaded, type
```
npm run start

```

This will automatically open a window in the browser that has the app's QR code and some other options as well.

<b>Step 03</b>: The most hassle-free way would be to download the "Expo" application on your mobile device and make an account. Then following the command line prompts, log-in to the created account and then scan the QR code provided. This will automatically open your application in the device. You could also publish the project and scan the QR code to access the project from your mobile phone.

Note: You can also run the application using emulators and simulators.
